# Oscars Tweets Project 

Digital Humanities 150: Power and Authority on the Early American Frontier: Explorations with Text Analysis
University of California, Los Angeles 
March 2019

This is research project of the social media surrounding movies and awards seasons, completed using text analysis of tweets surrounding the days of the 2019 Oscars. Through this project, we hope to answer: 

1. Are the Oscar nominated movies described on twitter differently before and after the Oscars?
2. What factors make particular films more salient on twitter than others?
3. (Sentiment analysis?)

Our data set was created by using the [Twitter Archiving Google Sheet](https://tags.hawksey.info) (TAGS). TAGS is "a free Google Sheet Template which lets you setup and run automated collection of search results from Twitter." As the Oscaras was February 24, we collected tweets from Febrauary 22 - 25 using the "term parameter" from each of the movies nominated for Best Picture, Black Panther, BlacKkKlansman, Bohemian Rhapsody, The Faourite, Greenbook, Roma, A Star is Born, and Vice. We also set a parameter requiring returned tweets be from users with more than 2,000 followers. In the CSV_Files folder, view the CSV Files returned from TAGS.
