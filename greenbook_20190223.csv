All I want from the Oscars is Green Book to win Best Film and Rami Malek or Willem Dafoe to win Best Actor.
ainda tenho que asssitir roma, a favorita e green book
@BenMank77 Because of the times we live in I hope Green Book wins best picture. And Spike Lee wins best director for BlacKKKlansman and a lifetime of original work.
@pmgonzalvez Ìäl y Ali son lo mejor de 'Green Book'. De hecho... creo que son lo Ì¼nico bueno
